AINS: Affordable Indoor Navigation Solution

This repository contains the implementation of the Affordable Indoor Navigation Solution (AINS), a vision-based navigation system designed for autonomous vehicles operating in indoor environments. AINS utilizes a mono-camera to identify line colors for accurate path detection and navigation. The system employs image processing techniques such as Gaussian filtering for noise reduction, HSV color space transformation for color identification, and contour-based edge detection for path segmentation. The calculated path is then used to guide the vehicle through indoor settings with minimal errors.
Features

    Vision-Based Navigation: Utilizes a mono-camera to detect and follow paths in real-time.
    Image Processing: Implements Gaussian filtering, HSV color space transformation, and contour detection to accurately identify and navigate paths.
    Angle Calculation: Determines the angle of the path relative to the vehicle using trigonometric functions, enabling precise steering.
    Real-Time Performance: Optimized for real-time indoor navigation, ensuring the vehicle can quickly and accurately follow the detected path.
